# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project delves into customer churn patterns, exploring factors that influence customer retention. Using a dataset containing details about customers, their chosen services, tenure, and churn status, several insights were derived.

Key analyses included:
- Exploring the relationship between customer tenure and churn.
- Investigating the impact of different types of internet services (DSL, Fiber Optic) on churn.
- Assessing the influence of add-on services like Online Security, Tech Support, Streaming TV, and Streaming Movies on churn.
- Analyzing the correlation between different payment methods and churn rates.

## Key Insights

1. **Early Tenure & Churn**: Many customers tend to leave the service within the initial months. However, those who've been with the service longer demonstrate greater loyalty.
2. **Impact of Add-On Services**: Online Security and Tech Support services were identified as significant factors in enhancing customer retention, while entertainment-centric services like Streaming TV and Streaming Movies had a balanced churn rate.
3. **Payment Methods & Churn**: Electronic checks as a payment method were associated with higher churn rates compared to other methods.

## Recommendations

- Enhance early customer engagement strategies to reduce churn during the initial months.
- Promote core services like Online Security and Tech Support to bolster customer loyalty.
- Investigate and address potential issues with the electronic check payment method.

## Note on Data Biases

While the data provided valuable insights, potential biases like sampling bias, non-response bias, and measurement errors could influence the results. It's essential to understand the data collection context and methodology for a comprehensive analysis.
